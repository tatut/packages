# cljsjs/p5

[](dependency)
```clojure
[cljsjs/p5 "0.7.2-0"] ;; latest release
```
[](/dependency)

This jar comes with `deps.cljs` as used by the [Foreign Libs][flibs] feature
of the ClojureScript compiler. After adding the above dependency to your project
you can require the packaged library like so:

```clojure
(ns application.core
  (:require cljsjs.p5))
```

The `externs` were auto-generated by the [Javascript Externs Generator](https://github.com/jmmk/javascript-externs-generator) and then hand edited. Mainly adding the functions defined nested in the main `p5` class to the prototype of the appropriate classes. I'm not sure how necessary it was to do that because I discovered the error I was receiving during advanced compilation was actually related to a clash with a namespace, but it works!

Learn about p5.js at https://p5js.org/ and lots of tutorials on [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman)

A wrapper library, [p5-cljs](https://github.com/pablinos/p5-cljs), is in early development.
