CLJSJS package for [diffdom](https://github.com/pieroxy/lz-string). This library allows the abstraction of differences between DOM elements as a "diff" object, representing the sequence of modifications that must be applied to one element in order to turn it into the other element. This diff is non-destructive, meaning that relocations of DOM nodes are preferred over remove-insert operations. For more info please visit [diffdom at github](https://github.com/fiduswriter/diffDOM)
