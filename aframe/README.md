Externs generated by running [npm's version of A-Frame](https://unpkg.com/aframe@0.8.2/dist/aframe-master.js) through [`jmmk`'s Javascript Externs Generator'](https://github.com/jmmk/javascript-externs-generator).

Changed 50 instances of ` - ` in the generated externs to `.` using Vim regular expressions

The generated A-Frame externs includes 50 instances of `x - y`, changed into `['x-y']`
with the follow regular expressions in Vim:
<!--  -->
<!-- &#45; `%s/\v.(\w+) &#45; (\w+)./['\1&#45;\2'].` -->
<!-- Then followed by this to fix names with two dashes in their name (as in 'oculus&#45;touch&#45;controls') -->
<!-- &#45; `%s/\v\']\.&#45; (\w+)./&#45;\1'].` -->
<!--  -->
<!-- The A-Frame source includes 42 instances of attempting to assing variables with `-`'s in their names. These were changed in Vim using the following regular expression: `%s/\v.(\w+) - (\w+)/['\1-\2']` -->
